//! # Operator Module
//!
//! Streaming operators for transforming and processing events.
//!
//! ## Operator Types
//!
//! - **Stateless**: map, filter, flatmap
//! - **Stateful**: window, aggregate, join
//!
//! All operators implement the `Operator` trait and can be composed into
//! directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for complex stream processing.
