## Last Session

**Date**: 2026-02-10

### What Was Accomplished
- **F017D+E: Session Emit Strategies + Timer Persistence** — Completes Issue #55
  - Added `needs_timer_reregistration` flag for lazy timer re-registration after restore
  - `restore()` sets flag when pending timers are recovered; `process()` re-registers them with `TimerService`
  - Verified all 5 emit strategies work correctly with session windows (OnWatermark, OnWindowClose, OnUpdate, Changelog, Final)
  - 5 new tests: OnWatermark no intermediate emits, OnWindowClose no intermediate emits, Changelog timer output, OnUpdate progressive counts, timer re-registration after restore
  - `on_watermark_advance()` deemed unnecessary — session windows use the same timer-based closure pattern as tumbling/sliding windows
  - 42 total session window tests, 1,423 laminar-core tests, all passing

Previous session (2026-02-10):
- **F017B: Session State Refactoring** — Multi-session per key support (commit `5e8dc79`)
- **F017C: Session Merging & Overlap Detection** — Core fix for Issue #55 (commit `3734954`)

Previous session (2026-02-08):
- **pgwire-replication integration for PostgreSQL CDC WAL streaming** (PR #74, closes #58)
- **FFI API Surface Update** — Exposed full LaminarDB API through `api::Connection` (PR #49)
- **Unified Checkpoint System (F-CKP-001 through F-CKP-009)** — ALL 9 FEATURES COMPLETE

### Where We Left Off

**Phase 2: 38/38 features COMPLETE (100%)** ✅
**Phase 3: 67/76 features COMPLETE (88%)**

Session window hardening (Issue #55): F017B ✅, F017C ✅, F017D ✅, F017E ✅

**Test counts**: ~1,423 laminar-core (base), ~3,100+ with all feature flags

### Immediate Next Steps

**Phase 3 remaining work**:
1. F027 follow-ups: TLS cert path support for pgwire-replication, initial snapshot, auto-reconnect
2. F031B/C/D: Delta Lake advanced (recovery, compaction, schema evolution)
3. F032A: Iceberg I/O (blocked by iceberg-rust DF 52.0 compat)
4. Remaining Phase 3 gaps (F029, F030, F033, F058, F061)

### Open Issues
- **pgwire-replication TLS**: `SslMode::Require`/`VerifyCa`/`VerifyFull` currently fall back to disabled — need cert path configuration plumbing.
- **iceberg-rust crate**: Deferred until compatible with workspace DataFusion. Business logic complete in F032.
- No other blockers.
